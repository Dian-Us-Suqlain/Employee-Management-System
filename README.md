# My-Personal-Projects
I designed &amp; developed this project during my Android Development course at University. 
It's an Employee Management System which allows employers and employees to create accounts and enter their personal and work related details.

User can Sign In and Sign Up. I have used Firebase Auth at backend for a secure sign in.

This project includes multiple functionalities and features such as:
  Sign In/Up
  CRUD Operations - Add, Read, Update or Delete an Employee.
  Display Employee details with the help of a Recycler View.
  
I have used recycler view to update employee data as I don't know how many employees would be added in a certain company. So, just for the safe side my recycler view would 
keep updating the employee data and display them on a separate activity.

HOW TO RUN!

Simply download the src file and import it in Android Studio, after the gradle build is successful. You would be able to run it on your mobile phone.
